# Using Machine-Learning to predict student grades

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I have shared my code and documentation related to my analysis of student grades across various parameters.

Through this analysis, I gained insights into the grade distribution compared with different factors and determined if there is a correlation between a specific aspect and better performance. My aim was to help educational institutions identify the factors that lead to better student performance and develop effective strategies to improve outcomes.

In this repository, you'll find my code for data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization, which I completed using various tools and libraries such as Python, R, and Tableau. Additionally, I have provided detailed documentation explaining the methodology used and the results obtained from the analysis.

Furthermore, I have included a discussion on the potential benefits and drawbacks of different grading systems, such as pass-fail grading, in enhancing classroom learning and student outcomes. Through this discussion, I have highlighted the importance of carefully considering the potential impact of grading systems on student performance and future opportunities.

Overall, my goal for this repository is to provide a comprehensive analysis of student grades using various parameters and contribute to improving educational outcomes. Thank you for visiting my repository!

Good education enriches people's lives in a significant way. An educational institution's success can be measured using its students' progress. Analyzing student performance is essential for academic institutions as well as their educators. It helps them strategize to improve the student's performance as a whole and individually. We here propose a Student Grade Prediction analysis that employs various Machine learning algorithms based on their accuracy and F1-score. Conventional student performance analysis systems have started to lack in various aspects. Grading affects a student's life significantly and is of tantamount importance in their lives. Therefore, there is a staunch need for a better method to analyze and classify student performance and grades. Thus, to tackle these issues, we present this study. Machine Learning is an intriguing way to help us find answers to these problems. We can choose various optimal classification techniques, customized as per requirements, to analyze the grades. We also see that the Decision Tree Classifier works best with the datasets. GridSearchCV is used to perform the model selection and hyperparameter tuning. This technique helps us improve accuracy by selecting the best hyperparameters from a predefined range. This makes the model better aligned for predicting the given dataset.
