# Using Machine-Learning to predict student grades
Good education enriches people's lives in a significant way. An educational institution's success can be measured using its students' progress. Analyzing student performance is essential for academic institutions as well as their educators. It helps them strategize to improve the student's performance as a whole and individually. We here propose a Student Grade Prediction analysis that employs various Machine learning algorithms based on their accuracy and F1-score. Conventional student performance analysis systems have started to lack in various aspects. Grading affects a student's life significantly and is of tantamount importance in their lives. Therefore, there is a staunch need for a better method to analyze and classify student performance and grades. Thus, to tackle these issues, we present this study. Machine Learning is an intriguing way to help us find answers to these problems. We can choose various optimal classification techniques, customized as per requirements, to analyze the grades. We also see that the Decision Tree Classifier works best with the datasets. GridSearchCV is used to perform the model selection and hyperparameter tuning. This technique helps us improve accuracy by selecting the best hyperparameters from a predefined range. This makes the model better aligned for predicting the given dataset.
